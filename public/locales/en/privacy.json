Introduction\n\nYour service provider is Booksource Technology Limited., a company operating under the laws of HongKong, Level 54，Hopewell Centre 183 Queen’s Road East, HongKong. We recognizes that your privacy is very important, and we take it seriously. Your privacy and trust are very important to us, and it is our commitment to being transparent about the use of collected information.\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes NovelRead’s policies and procedures on the collection, use, disclosure, and sharing of your personal information or personal data, and the choices you can make about how we use this information when you access or use our Site, Application, and/or Services.\n\nNote that NovelRead’s Terms of Service apply to this Privacy Policy. By accessing or using the NovelRead website and application, you are consenting that you unconditionally accept this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms found on this Privacy Policy, please do not use the NovelRead Services.\n\nTHIS PRIVACY POLICY IS IMPORTANT. WE HOPE YOU WILL TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT CAREFULLY.\n\nB. Age restrictions\n\nNovelRead is not intended for children. Children under the age of 12 must not use our Site, Application, and/or Services for any purpose. NovelRead will never knowingly solicit or accept personally identifiable information or other content from a user or visitor who NovelRead knows is under 12 years of age. If NovelRead discovers that a user under 12 years of age has created an account, or that a user or visitor under 12 years of age has posted personally identifiable information or other content to the Service, NovelRead will terminate the account and remove the information or other content.\n\nUsers between 12 and 18 (each a “Teen”) may not access or use the Service unless (i) both the Teen and their parent or legal guardian have first agreed to these Terms of Service; and (ii) the Teen uses an account established by their parent or legal guardian, under such parent or guardian’s supervision, and with such parent or guardian’s permission.

Data Collection\n\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services– from figuring out basic stuff such as which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the author who matter most to you online or which stories you might like.\n\nWhen you interact with our Site, Application, and/or Services, we collect information that could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”). Some of the information we collect is stored in a manner that cannot be linked back to you (“Non-Personal Data”).\n\nWhen you log in, we collect information that we store with your account (typically your nickname, email address, and a password for your account), which we treat as personal information. This log information may include but not limited to your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and cookie data. If you log into NovelRead with a social networking credential, such as with a third-party account, we will ask permission to access basic information from that account, such as your name and email address. You can stop sharing that information with us at any time by removing NovelRead’s access to that account. When you do not log in to our services, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the application and device you’re using. This collection helps us do things such as maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.\n\nWe collect your payment information if you are a paying customer. This information is required to complete a commercial transaction on our Applications and our Sites. We use this information to enable and fulfill your transaction. If you choose to use any third-party’s service to finalize and pay for your order, you will provide your credit card number directly to the third-party. The privacy policy of the third-party will apply to the information you provide on its website.\n\nIf you choose to participate in our survey, we may request certain Information (including Personal Data and Non-Personal Data) from you, and this information will be used to provide personalized help and instructions.\n\nThe information we collect and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\n\nD.
